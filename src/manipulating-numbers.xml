  <title>Manipulating Numbers</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> This section is included because <q>it's not crazy until someone says it's crazy</q>; and hence I would like now to point out that some beliefs about high school mathematics <em>are crazy.</em> </p> 
      <p> What's the upshot? Well, you might like to know that graduate students <em>also</em> have to go through similar <q>spirals of understanding</q>, so you're in good company. The mathematics question-answer site on <code>stackexchange.com</code> has even kept a running list <url href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478" /> of such misconceptions, based off a post from the british mathematician Timothy Gowers in 2015. </p>

    <title>Exponent Properties</title>
    <p>Problems with exponents may often be simplified using a few basic exponent properties. For now, exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to discover the important properties.</p>
    <historical>
      <title>World View Note</title>
      <p>The word exponent comes from the Latin <q>expo</q> meaning out of and <q>ponere</q> meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back to the 23rd century BC or earlier!).</p>
    </historical>
    <example>
      <title>Multiply <m>a^n</m> times <m>a^m</m> using Exponents</title>
        <!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 196 pg 177-->
      <p>Multipy <m>a^3</m> times <m>a^2</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>a^3a^2 \amp\amp\amp \text{Represent }a^4\text{ and }a^2\text{ as products}</mrow>
        <mrow>(aaa)(aa) \amp\amp\amp \text{Regroup}</mrow>
        <mrow>(aaaaa) \amp\amp\amp \text{Represent the product with an exponent}</mrow>
        <mrow>a^5\amp\amp\amp\text{Our Solution} \checkmark</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </example>
  <p>The example shows that <m>a^3</m> times <m>a^2</m> just represents <m>3+2</m>
    <m>a</m>'s multiplied together.  Similarly, <m>(a^m)(a^n)</m> just represents <m>(m+n)</m>
    <m>a</m>'s multiplied together. This is known as the <term>product rule of exponents</term>:
    <men xml:id="exponents-product-rule">
      <mrow>\text{Product Rule of Exponents: }
        a^m a^n=a^{m+n}
    </mrow>
  </men>
    Note: In the expression <m>a^n</m>, <m>n</m> is called the <term>exponent</term> and <m>a</m> is called the <term>base</term>.</p>
  <p>The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. This is shown in the following examples.</p>
  <example>
    <title>Product Rule of Exponents</title>
      <!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 197 pg 177-->
    <p>Multiply:

  </exercise>
  <p>Next, we consider what happens when we divide with exponents.</p>
  <example>
    <title>Division with Exponents</title>
      <!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 199 pg 177-->
    <p>Divide:
    <md>
      <mrow>\dfrac{a^5}{a^2} \amp\amp\amp \text{Expand exponents}</mrow>
      <mrow>\dfrac{aaaaa}{aa} \amp\amp\amp \text{Since \(\frac{a}{a} = 1\), each \(a\) in the bottom "cancels" an \(a\) in the top.}</mrow>
      <mrow>aaa \amp\amp\amp \text{Convert to exponents}</mrow>
      <mrow>a^3 \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution}\checkmark</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
</example>
<p>Because the two <m>a</m>'s represented by <m>a^2</m> cancel two of the five <m>a</m>'s represented by <m>a^5</m>, there are <m>5-2=3</m> <m>a</m>'s left after cancelling.  Thus, dividing <m>a^5</m> by <m>a^2</m> just amounts to subtracting the exponents <m>\dfrac{a^5}{a^2} = a^{5-2}= a^3</m>. In a similar way, <m>\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}</m>. This is known as the <term>quotient rule of exponents</term>:
<mdn>
  <mrow xml:id="exponents-quotient-rule"> \text{Quotient Rule of Exponents: }
    \frac{a^m}{ a^n} =a^{m-n}

      </md>
    </p>
  </example>
  <p>A third property we will look at will have an exponent problem raised to a second exponent. This is investigated in the following example:</p>
  <example>
    <title>Powers with Exponents</title>
      <!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 202 pg 178-->
    <p>Multiply:
    <md>
      <mrow>\left(a^2\right)^3 \amp\amp\amp \text{This means we have three \(a^2\)'s multiplied together}</mrow>
      <mrow>a^2 \cdot a^2 \cdot a^2 \amp\amp\amp \text{Each }a^2\text{ represent the produce of two }a\text{'s}</mrow>
      <mrow>(aa)(aa)(aa) \amp\amp\amp \text{Three groups of two make six }a\text{'s in all multiplied together}</mrow>
      <mrow>a^6 \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution}\checkmark</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
</example>
<p>Since three groups of two is <m>3 \cdot 2 = 6</m>, a quicker method to arrive at the solution is to just multiply the exponents, <m>(a^2)^3 = a^{2\cdot 3} = a^6</m>. This is known as the <term>power of a power rule of exponents</term>:
<mdn>
  <mrow xml:id="exponents-power-of-a-power-rule"> \text{Power of a Power Rule of Exponents: }
    (a^m)^n=a^{mn}
</mrow>
</mdn>
</p>
<p>This property is often combined with two other properties which we will investigate now.</p>
<example>
  <title>Powers of Products</title>
    <!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 203 pg 178-->
  <p>Multiply:
  <md>
    <mrow>(ab)^3 \amp\amp\amp \text{This means we have \((ab)\) three times}</mrow>
    <mrow>(ab)(ab)(ab) \amp\amp\amp \text{Regroup the variables}</mrow>
    <mrow>(aaa)(bbb) \amp\amp\amp \text{The product of three \(a\)'s and three \(b\)'s can be written with exponents}</mrow>
    <mrow>a^3 b^3 \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution}\checkmark</mrow>
  </md>
</p>
    </example>
    <p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution is to take the exponent,
    <m>3,</m> and put it on each factor in parentheses,
    <m>(ab)^3 = a^3b^3</m>. This is known as the
    <term>power of a product rule of exponents</term>:
    <mdn>
      <mrow xml:id="exponents-power-of-a-product-rule"> \text{Power of a Product Rule of Exponents: }
        (ab)^m=a^m b^m
    </mrow>
  </mdn>
</p>
<p>It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multiplication inside parentheses. This property does NOT work if there is addition or subtraction inside the parentheses.</p>
<historical>
  <title>The First-year's Dream</title>
  <p>Since the 1940s, mathematicians have described a special situation in which this warning is irrelevant as <term>the First-year's Dream</term>. This situation occurs in a certain <q>number system</q> called a <term>ring of characteristic <m>p</m>
  </term>. It's been considered bad practice to mention such number systems to first-years students, because in such systems, the rules of exponentiation are <q>too good to be true</q>. For example, the mathematician Saunders Mac Lane believed that a knowledge of <m>(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2</m> in a ring of characteristic <m>2</m> would corrupt first-year students of algebra. Fortunately, the only number systems we will work with have characteristic <m>0</m>, in which case <m>(a + b)^0 = a^0 + b^0</m>, a.k.a., <m>1=1</m>. But we already knew that, didn't we?</p>

  <title>WARNING</title>
    <!-- All but the last line was written by rac.  Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Warning 204 pg 179-->
  <p>The Power of a Product Rule only applies to products.  It does <term>not</term> apply to sums for any exponent not equal to <m>1</m>. For example,
  <md>
    <mrow>(1+2)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \amp\amp \text{But,}</mrow>
    <mrow>1^2+2^2 = 1+4 = 5 \amp\amp \text{So, }</mrow>
    <mrow>(1+2)^2 \neq 1^2+2^2 \amp\amp \text{The rule does not hold for a sum.}</mrow>

  <p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution is to put the exponent on every factor in both the numerator and denominator,

    <p>These five properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit of flexibility as to which property is used first. However, order of operations still applies to a problem. For this reason it is our suggestion to simplify inside any parentheses first, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and finally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules). </p>
    <p>These problems can quickly become quite involved. Remember to follow order of operations as a guide, simplify inside parenthesis first, then power rules, then product and quotient rules.</p>

    <title>Radicals as Exponents</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>What is <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m>? Many students will answer quickly that the answer is <m>(x + 3)</m> and have a very difficult time believing this answer is wrong. But it is wrong.</p>
      <p>For positive values of <m>x</m>, <m>\sqrt{x^2}</m> <em>is</em> <m>x</m> and <m>\sqrt{9}</m> <em>is</em> <m>3</m>, but <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> is not <m>(x + 3).</m></p>
      <p>Why not? Remember that <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> is asking a question: <q>what <em>squared</em> gives the answer <m>x^2 + 9</m>?</q> So <m>(x + 3)</m> is not an answer, because <m>(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x+9</m>, not <m>x^2 + 9</m>.</p>
      <p>As an example, suppose <m>x = 4</m>. Substituting into <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> gives <m>\sqrt{4^2 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5</m>. But substituting into <m>(x + 3)</m> gives, <m>(4 + 3) = 7</m>.  That is, when <m>x = 4</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\sqrt{x^2 + 9} = \sqrt{4^2 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5\neq 7 = (4+3)=(x+3)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p><alert>Note:</alert> If two numbers are added or subtracted under a square root, you cannot split them up. In symbols: <m>\sqrt{a + b} \neq \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}</m> or, to put it another way, <m>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \neq x + y.</m></p>
    <p><m>\sqrt{x^2 + 9}</m> cannot, in fact, be simplified at all. It is a perfectly valid function, but cannot be rewritten in a simpler form. </p>

    <p>How about <m>\sqrt{9x^2}</m>? By analogy to the previous discussion, you might expect that this cannot be simplified either. But in fact, it can be simplified:
    <md>
      <mrow>\sqrt{9x^2} = 3x</mrow>
    </md>
      Why? Again, <m>\sqrt{9x^2}</m> is asking <q>what squared gives the answer <m>9x^2</m>?</q> The answer is <m>3x</m> because <m>(3x)^2 = 9x^2.</m></p>
    <p>Similarly, <m>\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{9}{x^2}} = \frac{3}{x}</m> , because <m>\displaystyle \left(\frac{3}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{x^2}</m>.</p>
    <p>There are radicals (or roots) other than a square root: <m>\sqrt[3]{27}</m> means <q>what number raised to the third power gives <m>27</m></q>.  In this case, <m>3^3=27</m> so <m>\sqrt[3]{27} = 3</m>.  Similarly, <m>\sqrt[4]{16} = 2.</m></p>

        SageMath (or just <q>Sage</q>)

      <p>
          The first version of SageMath was released on 24 February 2005 as free and open-source software.
          The originator and leader of the SageMath project, William Stein, is a mathematician (a number theorist) at the University of Washington.
          Colton started using Sage in 2013, based on the recommendation of Dave Rosoff, who taught at the College of Idaho and studied at UW.

          @interact # please evaluate me, and ignore the code for now
          def slider(exponent = slider(0,10,2,2)):
              yi, yj, yk = sqrt(x^exponent + 9), sqrt(x^exponent)  + 3, x^(exponent/2)  + 3

              show(graph)

    <p>The way we generally consider exponents is as repeated multiplication: <m>10^6</m> means <m>10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10</m>. But this definition of exponents does not enable us to answer questions such as:
    <md>
      <mrow>4^0\amp = ??</mrow>
      <mrow>5^{-4}\amp =??</mrow>
      <mrow>9^{1/2}\amp = ??</mrow>
    </md>
      You can't <q>multiply <m>9</m> by itself half a time</q> or <q>multiply <m>5</m> by itself <m>-4</m> times.</q> We need a different way of considering the exponent in these cases.</p>

    <p>Note that you can combine these definitions. For instance, <m>8^{-2/3}</m> is a negative, fractional exponent. The negative exponent means, as always, "put me in the denominator." So we can write:
    <md>
      <mrow>8^{-2/3} = \frac{1}{8^{2/3}} = \frac{1}{(\sqrt[3]{8})^2} = \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}</mrow>
  </md></p>

  <remark>
    <title>
        OK, so why define exponents that way?
    </title>

    <p>These are obviously not chosen to be the simplest possible definitions. But they are chosen to be consistent with the behavior of positive-integer exponents. One way to see that consistency is to consider the following progression:
    <md>
      <mrow>19^4 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</mrow>
      <mrow>19^3 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</mrow>
      <mrow>19^2 = 19 \cdot 19</mrow>
      <mrow>19^1 = 19</mrow>
    </md>
      What happens each time we decrease the exponent by <m>1</m>? Your first response might be <q>we have one less <m>19</m>.</q> But what is really happening, mathematically, to the numbers on the right? The answer is that, with each step, they are dividing by <m>19</m>. If you take <m>19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</m>, and divide it by <m>19</m>, you get <m>19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19</m>. Divide that by <m>19</m> again, and you get <m>19 \cdot 19</m> <m>\ldots</m> and so on. From this we can formulate the following principle for the powers of <m>19</m>:</p>
    <p>Whenever you <em>subtract</em> <m>1</m> from the exponent, you <em>divide the answer</em> by <m>19.</m></p>
    <p>As we said earlier, we want the behavior of our new exponents to be consistent with the behavior of the old (positive-integer) exponents. So we can continue this progression as follows:
    <md>
      <mrow>19^1 \amp =19</mrow>
      <mrow>19^0 \amp =\frac{19}{19} = 1</mrow>
      <mrow>19^{-1} \amp = \frac{1}{19}</mrow>
      <mrow>19^{-2}  \amp = \frac{\frac{1}{19}}{19} = \frac{1}{19^2}</mrow>
    </md>
    <m>\ldots</m> and so on. We arrive at our definitions that anything to the zero power is <m>1</m> and negative exponents go to the denominator by simply requiring this progression to be consistent.</p>
</remark>

<p>More rigorously, we can find all our exponent definitions by using the laws of exponents. For instance, what is <m>4^0</m>? We can approach this question indirectly by asking: what is <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}</m>?
<ul>
  <li>The second law of exponents tells us that <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2} = 4^{2-2}</m>, which is <m>4^0</m>.</li>
  <li>But of course, <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}</m> is just <m>\dfrac{16}{16}</m> , or <m>1</m>.</li>
  <li>Since <m>\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}</m> is both <m>4^0</m> and <m>1</m>, <m>4^0</m> and <m>1</m> must be the same thing!</li>
</ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proofs given below all follow this pattern. They use the laws of exponents to rewrite expressions such as <m>\frac{4^2}{4^2}</m> , and go on to show how zero, negative, and fractional exponents must be defined. We started with the definition of an exponent for a positive integer, <m>10^6 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10</m>. From there, we developed the laws of exponents. Now we find that, if we want those same laws to apply to other kinds of exponents, there is only one correct way to define those other kinds of exponents.</p>

              <p>Now that we have a firm understanding of how to deal with expressions like <m>x^{n/m}</m> where <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are integers, we could extend the idea to expressions like <m>x^r</m> where <m>r</m> is a real number. We will demonstrate how such a critter would be calculated, but not go into the mathematical underpinnings for the expression in this course. Let's see how one would go about calculating <m>2^\pi</m>. Recall that <m>\pi \approx 3.14159 \dots</m>. Consider
              <md>
                <mrow>2^3 \amp =8</mrow>
                <mrow>2^{3.1} \amp =2^{\frac{31}{10}} =  \sqrt[10]{2^{31}} = 8.5741877 \dots</mrow>
                <mrow>2^{3.14} \amp =2^{\frac{314}{100}} =  \sqrt[100]{2^{314}} = 8.815241 \dots</mrow>
                <mrow>2^{3.141} \amp =2^{\frac{3141}{1000}} =  \sqrt[1000]{2^{3141}} = 8.821353 \dots</mrow>
                <mrow>2^{3.1415} \amp =2^{\frac{31415}{10000}} =  \sqrt[10000]{2^{31415}} = 8.824411 \dots</mrow>
                <mrow>2^{3.14159} \amp =2^{\frac{314159}{100000}} =  \sqrt[100000]{2^{314159}} = 8.824962 \dots</mrow>
              </md>
                As we use more digits of <m>\pi</m>, the digits of the result begin to stabilize.  Note that after the last calculation the first four digits haven't changed: <m>8.824</m>. We won't ever get an exact value for <m>2^\pi</m> since <m>\pi</m>'s digits don't repeat, but we can get as accurate a number as we need by using enough digits to calculate <m>2^\pi</m>.</p>

              <title>Common Mistakes</title>

                  <p>When solving equations that involve radicals, begin by asking yourself: is there an <m>x</m> under the square root? The answer to this question will determine the way you approach the problem.</p>
                  <p>If there is not an <m>x</m> under the square root <ndash/> if only numbers are under the radicals <ndash/> you can solve much the same way you would solve with no radicals at all.</p>

                  </example>
                  <p>The key thing to note about such problems is that you do not have to square both sides of the equation. <m>\sqrt{ 2}</m> may look ugly, but it is just a number<ndash/>you could find it on your calculator if you wanted to<ndash/>it functions in the equation just the way that the number <m>10</m>, or <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> , or <m>\pi</m> would.</p>
                  <p>If there is an <m>x</m> under the square root, the problem is completely different. You will have to square both sides to get rid of the radical. However, there are two important notes about this kind of problem.
                  <ol>
                    <li>If possible, always get the radical alone, on one side of the equation, before squaring.</li>
                    <li>Squaring both sides can introduce false answers<ndash/>so it is important to check your answers after solving!</li>
                  </ol>
                    Both of these principles are demonstrated in the following example.</p>

                    <p>So the algebra yielded two solutions: <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>-1</m>. Checking, however, we discover that only the first solution is valid. This problem demonstrates how important it is to check solutions whenever squaring both sides of an equation.</p>
                    <p>If variables under the radical occur more than once, you will have to go through this procedure multiple times. Each time, you isolate a radical and then square both sides.</p>
                  </example>

                  <p>Why is it that<ndash/>when squaring both sides of an equation<ndash/>perfectly good algebra can lead to invalid solutions? The answer is in the redundancy of squaring. Consider the following equation:
                  <md>
                    <mrow>-5 = 5\text{, is false.}</mrow>
                  </md>
                    But square both sides, and we get...
                  <md>
                    <mrow>25 = 25\text{, which is true!}</mrow>
                  </md>
                    So squaring both sides of a false equation can produce a true equation.</p>
                  <p>To see how this affects our equations, try plugging <m>x = -1</m> into the various steps of <xref ref="example-rewrite-radical-2" text="type-global"/>:</p>
                  <p>
                    <md>
                      <mrow>\sqrt{x + 2} + 3x\amp = 5x + 1\amp\amp\text{Does \(x = -1\) work here? No, it does not.}</mrow>
                      <mrow>\sqrt{x + 2}\amp = 2x + 1\amp\amp\text{How about here? No, \(x = -1\) produces the false equation \(1 = -1\).}</mrow>
                      <mrow>x + 2\amp = (2x + 1)^2\amp\amp\text{Suddenly, \(x = -1\) works. (Try it!)}</mrow>
                    </md>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we squared both sides, we <q>lost</q> the difference between <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>, and they <q>became equal.</q> From here on, when we solved, we ended up with <m>x = -1</m> as a valid solution. So, the moral of the story is if you square an equation in the course of solving it, you will need to check your answer to make sure a false one didn't sneak in.</p>

                    <title>From Falsehood, Anything Follows</title>
                    <p>It vulgar Latin, that's <em>ex falso quod libet</em>. It means literally <q>from falsehood, anything</q> and refers to a certain assumption most mathematicians make when dealing with contradictions. If you think this principle is suspicious, you might empathize with a (quite lovely) school of philosophy called <em>intuitionism</em>.</p>

                    <p>For this course, we might want to make use of <term>de Morgan's laws</term>, the idea of which is that not <q>something or someother</q> implies neither <q>something nor someother</q>. Therefore, we will <em>not</em> take the intuitionist approach, but rather, we will follow a formal approach in which sentiments like <q>either something is true or that same thing is false</q> are always true.</p>
