  <title>Setting Up Coordinates</title>

    <p>Math became far more intuitive and powerful when people learned to marry the precision of algebra to the visual intuition of geometry. Simply put, we seek to find a way to draw algebraic things. Let's start with the Cartesian Coordinate Plane, named in honor of the 17th century philosopher, mathematician and scientist, Rene Decartes.</p>
    <p>Imagine two real number lines crossing at a right angle at <m>0</m> as drawn below.</p>

    <p>The horizontal number line is usually called the <m>x</m>-axis while the vertical number line is usually called the <m>y</m>-axis. As with the usual number line, we imagine these axes extending off indefinitely in both directions. Having two number lines enables us to locate the positions of points off of the number lines as well as points on the lines themselves.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the point <m>P</m> shown below:</p>

  <p>To use the numbers on the axes to label this  point, imagine dropping a vertical line from the <m>x</m>-axis to <m>P</m> and extending a horizontal line from the <m>y</m>-axis to <m>P</m>. This process is sometimes called <q>projecting</q> the point <m>P</m> to the <m>x</m>- (respectively <m>y</m>-) axis. We then locate the point <m>P</m> using the ordered pair <m>(2,-4).</m> The first number in the ordered pair is the <m>x</m>-coordinate and the second is the <m>y</m>-coordinate. Taken together, the ordered pair <m>(2, -4)</m> gives the position of the point <m>P</m> with respect to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes.
</p>
<p>Notice that the order in the ordered pair is important: if we wish to plot the point <m>(-4, 2),</m> we would move to the left <m>4</m> units from the origin and then move upwards <m>2</m> units.</p>

              <!-- </introduction> -->
            <p>Most students entering this course are already familiar with the basic mechanics of graphing lines. Recapping very briefly: the equation for a line is <m>y = mx + b</m> where <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept  and <m>m</m> is the slope.   This form of the equation for a line is sometimes called the <term>slope-intercept</term> form because the slope and vertical intercept are clearly seen.</p>
            <example xml:id="example-linear-equation">
              <title>Determine Slope and Intercept from Linear Equation</title>
              <p>Any equation that can be written in slope-intercept form is the equation for a line. So, <m>2x-5y = 15</m> represents a line since:
              <md>
                <mrow>2x-5y &amp; = 15</mrow>
                <mrow>-5y &amp; = -2x+15</mrow>
                <mrow>y &amp; = \frac{2}{5}x-3.</mrow>
              </md>
                We see that the <m>y</m>-intercept of this line is at <m>y = -3</m> and the slope is <m>\frac{2}{5}.\checkmark</m></p>
            </example>

            <p>Not all equations represent lines. For example, <m>y = x^2 + 3x</m> does not define a line. It cannot be written in the form <m>y = mx + b.</m></p>
            <p>There are two purposes of reintroducing this material in this course. The first is to frame the discussion as linear functions modeling behavior. The second is to deepen your understanding of the important concept of slope.</p>
            <p>Consider the following examples. Sam is a salesman-he earns a commission for each sale. Alice is a technical support representative-she earns <m>\$100</m> each day. The chart below shows their bank accounts over the week.</p>

      <p>The slope of a line may be calculated from any two points on the line, <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>.  The "rise" is found by finding the difference between the two <m>y</m> values, <m>y_2 - y_1</m> and dividing by the "run", the difference in the <m>x</m> values: <m>x_2 - x_1</m>. Note that you must find the differences in the same order. You may not calculate the change from <m>y_1</m> to <m>y_2</m> and then the change from <m>x_2</m> to <m>x_1</m>.
